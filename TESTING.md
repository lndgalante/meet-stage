# BetterMeets testing guide

BetterMeets keeps deterministic decisions in plain Swift and treats macOS
framework integration as an edge. Tests should follow the same boundary: cover
policies, geometry, persistence, state transitions, and AppKit configuration in
automation; verify privacy prompts and live window-server behavior with the
packaged app.

## Test layers

| Layer | Examples | Expected coverage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pure policy and geometry | shortcut reconciliation, capture selection, window eligibility, normalized coordinates, stage sizing | Every branch and boundary value |
| Persistence | presentation settings, shortcut pins and exclusions, corrupt or legacy data | Defaults, round trips, normalization, and invalid input |
| Main-actor models | annotation fading, spotlight state, armed presentation effects | State changes and cancellation-sensitive behavior |
| AppKit integration | overlay window levels, event-monitor ownership, drag surfaces, workspace notifications | Configuration and callback translation that can run without privacy consent |
| Live macOS integration | ScreenCaptureKit, Accessibility permission, Carbon hotkeys, meeting-app window capture | Manual packaged-app verification |

## Required local checks

Run these before handing off a change:

```bash
swift format lint --strict --recursive Sources Tests Package.swift scripts/generate-app-icon.swift
swift test -Xswiftc -warnings-as-errors
swift build -c release -Xswiftc -warnings-as-errors
plutil -lint Resources/Info.plist
zsh -n build-app.sh dev-app.sh scripts/build-and-package.sh scripts/notarize-app.sh
git diff --check
```

Run `./build-app.sh` as well when changing packaging, resources, entitlements,
the Metal shader, or code paths that behave differently inside an app bundle.

## Writing maintainable tests

- Prefer Swift Testing suites named for behavior, with test names that describe
  the user-visible invariant rather than the implementation method.
- Put new decision logic in a plain value or policy and test it without
  ScreenCaptureKit, `UserDefaults.standard`, or a live workspace whenever
  possible.
- Use a unique `UserDefaults` suite and remove its persistent domain in cleanup.
- Keep UI and AppKit tests on `@MainActor`; do not hide actor crossings behind
  `@unchecked Sendable` test helpers unless a lock protects all shared state.
- Test both sides of coordinate boundaries. Window effects deliberately accept
  their maximum X/Y edges, while annotation drags clamp pointer overshoot.
- When fixing a bug, add the smallest regression test that fails for the old
  behavior and names the invariant that was violated.

## Manual platform matrix

After changing capture lifecycle, source discovery, presentation monitoring,
window configuration, or permissions, build the packaged debug app with
`./dev-app.sh` and verify:

1. Screen Recording permission can be requested, granted, and recovered by
   restarting the packaged app.
2. Selecting, switching, pausing, and resuming windows never publishes a source
   as live before its first complete frame.
3. Closing, minimizing, hiding, restoring, and renaming a source preserves the
   documented shortcut behavior.
4. Option+1 through Option+9 switch sources globally and report conflicts
   without changing capture state.
5. The Demo Stage remains draggable and resizable, preserves the selected
   source aspect ratio, and is capturable by the target meeting app.
6. Pointer capture, click ripples, spotlight, annotations, and keystrokes appear
   only for the focused selected source and clean up after switching or stopping.
7. Accessibility and Reduce Motion settings produce the documented fallback
   behavior.

Record the macOS version and meeting app when a manual result depends on
window-server or capture-framework behavior.
